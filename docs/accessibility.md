# Accessibility Features

Paracharts is designed with accessibility at its core, offering features that go beyond standard keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
These features are not only valuable for users of screen readers, but are also essential for voice-based interfaces such as smart speakers and smart glasses, where visual access to data is limited or unavailable.

## Keyboard Navigation

All interactive chart elements are accessible via keyboard.
Users can navigate data points, legends, and controls using standard keyboard shortcuts, ensuring full functionality without a mouse.

## Screen Reader Support

Paracharts provides semantic markup and ARIA attributes, enabling screen readers to accurately convey chart structure, data, and context.
This ensures users with visual impairments can understand and interact with charts effectively.

## Sonification

A key challenge with traditional chart accessibility is that serial navigation, which moves through data point by point, can be slow and overwhelming.
This makes it difficult to grasp overall trends or patterns.
Paracharts addresses this by translating chart data into audio cues.
Sonification allows users to perceive the shape, direction, and outliers in data through sound, providing an immediate sense of the dataâ€™s structure that would otherwise require extensive navigation.
This approach is especially useful for voice-based platforms, where audio is the primary mode of interaction.

## AI-Powered Descriptions

Paracharts uses AI to generate concise, context-aware textual summaries of charts.
These descriptions highlight key insights, trends, and anomalies, giving users a quick overview of the data.
This helps users understand the main points without needing to examine each data point individually, making data more accessible to those who rely on screen readers, voice assistants, or prefer text-based information.

---

Charts are powerful because they let users understand data quickly at a glance, a benefit often lost with serial navigation alone.
By combining sonification and AI-generated descriptions, Paracharts restores this essential function for all users.
These features enable a rapid, intuitive understanding of complex data, supporting a wide range of assistive technologies and making data visualization more inclusive.
