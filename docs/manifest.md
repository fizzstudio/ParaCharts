# Manifest Format

Each chart is specified using a JSON manifest.
ParaCharts manifests are extended JIM objects (see [the JIM specification](https://inclusio-community.github.io/json-image-metadata/) for more details).

The `Manifest` type is defined in the [ParaManifest package](https://github.com/fizzstudio/ParaManifest).

The data, parameters and settings needed to present a chart in ParaCharts. @public

A manifest has the following top-level properties. The table below lists each
property with its type, whether it is required, and a short description.

| Property | JSON path | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|:---:|---|
| `datasets` | `datasets` | `array` (items: `object`) | Yes | The data and parameters needed to present a chart in ParaCharts. |

If a property contains nested object properties, they are shown in a separate
subsection immediately after the parent property.
