- [Accessibility Features](accessibility.md) — sonification, screen reader behavior, and AI summaries.
- [Chart Types](chartTypes.md) — overview of chart types and guidance for choosing one.
- [Control Panel & Settings](controlPanel.md) — quick guide to the control panel tabs and common settings.

## Quick links — developer docs

- [Using Chart Components](using-chart-components.md) — how to embed ParaCharts components.
