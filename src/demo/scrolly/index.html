        <p>Industry remained a major part of China’s economy during this period but also saw a gradual decline in its
          share of GDP. In 2008, industry contributed nearly half of total output, driven by China’s role as the world’s
          main manufacturing hub. Over the decade, however, the share dropped to about 40 percent. Rising labor costs,
          stricter environmental regulations, and efforts to move up the value chain all played a role. China’s
          government began encouraging innovation and advanced manufacturing, but overall, the relative dominance of
          heavy industry and export-driven production started to ease.</p>

        <p>
          Services expanded relatively quickly and became the largest part of China’s economy by 2018. Starting at
          around 43 percent of GDP in 2008, the sector grew to over half within a decade. This growth came from booming
          industries such as finance, technology, logistics, retail, and tourism. As household incomes rose and cities
          developed, domestic consumption and service-based business activity increased sharply. The shift toward
          services reflects China’s broader economic transformation—less reliant on factories and exports, and more
          focused on urban lifestyles, digital innovation, and internal demand.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="fourth" data-para-enter="getSeries(Agriculture).getRecord(5).select() highlightSeries(Services)">
        <p>
          Agriculture's share of China's GDP gradually declined between 2008 and 2018 as the country continued to
          urbanize and modernize. In 2008, agriculture still made up about a tenth of the economy, but by 2018 it had
          fallen to around seven percent. This reflected rising efficiency in farming, widespread migration from rural
          to urban areas, and the shift of labor and investment toward more profitable sectors. Farming became
          increasingly mechanized and productive, even as it accounted for a smaller slice of total output.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="fifth" data-para-enter="highlightSeries(Services, Industry)">
        <p>
          In the decade from 2008 to 2018, China completed its transformation from a largely industrial and maufacturing
          exporter to a internal economy focused on services for its own population. This is reflected in the
          fluctuations between industry and services, as relative percentages of the economy, with services finally
          surpassing industry in 2012, and continuing to widen the gap for the next 6 years.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sixth" data-para-enter="highlightDatapoint(Services, 10)">
        <p>
          In 2018, services peaked at 52.2% of China's GDP, 11.5% higher than industry and 45% higher than agriculture.
